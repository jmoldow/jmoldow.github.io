													<h3>More Details</h3>
												</header>
												<p><strong>What is the dress code?</strong>
												<br>We suggest that guests come in "dressy casual", which could possibly include: button-up/dress shirts, slacks, blouses, evening dresses, polos, and dress shoes.
												<br>Also, note that the bride and groom will be wearing red and gold for the occasion so no color is off-limits.</p>
												<p><strong>When should I arrive?</strong>
												<br>While we will be greeting and entertaining guests starting at 6 PM, we recommend that you arrive no later than 6:30 PM so that you can mingle and enjoy appetizers before dinner is served.</p>
												<p><strong>When will the banquet end?</strong>
												<br>The banquet is over when we can eat no more! However, we encourage everyone to stick around and socialize as long as we have the space, which will be until Chef Chu's closes at 10 PM.</p>
												<p><strong>What food will be served?</strong>
												<br>We are planning for a multi-course meal with typical celebratory Chinese dishes. If you have dietary restrictions, we ask that you please let us know when you <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP</a>.
												<br>And of course, there will be cake!</p>

													<h3>Join us for food and fun with family and friends!</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Our celebration banquet to honor the marriage of Melissa Ko and Jordan Moldow will be held at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chefchu.com">Chef Chu's</a> (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/R31JMkyFPUy">1067 N San Antonio Rd, Los Altos, CA 94022</a>) on Saturday, May 5, 2018.</p>
												<p>We invite guests to join us for light snacks and mingling starting at 6 PM. Dinner will be served starting no later than 7 PM. When you arrive, go through the front entrance, immediately turn left, and take the stairs to the upstairs banquet room.</p>
												
												<p>After appetizers are done, dinner will be in the form of a traditional multi-course, family-style Chinese banquet. For those of you who are vegan or vegetarian, or allergies to the dishes, we've arranged for substitute dishes to be made available when necessary. For those who are pescetarian or can't eat fish, you should be able to eat most of the dishes aside from one or two.</p>

												<p>Chef Chu's is located at the intersection of San Antonio Road and El Camino Real. Some parking is available in front of the restaurant, but most parking can be found behind Chef Chu's.</p>
											<p>We highly recommend car-pooling, ride-sharing, or taking public transportation, as there is limited parking at Chef Chu's.</p>	
											<p>Be aware of signs around the lot and do not park in parking restricted to only Peet's or Armadillo Willy's customers.</p>
											<p>There is a secondary parking lot available on Acacia Avenue, a road that starts behind Chef Chu's, before the road intersects with Sherwood Avenue.</p>
